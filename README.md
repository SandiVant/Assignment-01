# What is Coding?

**Code** is a programming language used to tell the computer what needs to occur.


**C++** is used for games.
i.e. playstation, Xbox.

**PHP** is used for webpages.
i.e. etsy, facebook.

**Python** is general purpose.
i.e. Instagram, scientist.

**JavaScript** is used for software.
i.e. amazon.


# With Code

The computer takes the code and reads the language carefully, taking out unnecessary elements and leaving only tokens. The computer then organizes the tokens using a process called compilation util it is translated over to machine language.

-Humans write code, which turns into software.

##### There are 11 million professional software developers on earth. 7 billion do it for a hobby.

# Lets Begin

-Acomputer is a clock with benefits.
-Code hops from box to box looking for instruction.
-Code is the art.

#### How would you type "A"?

When typing on a keyboard, it sends a scancode.

If you were to type a letter for example the computer takes note of the signal from the keyboard; the version in memory; and the lines-and-circles version sketched in the screen. 

# From Hardware to Software

Software- Reproducible units of digital execution.

# How does code become software?

The goal is to turn it into an explicit list of insturctions. These instructions are carried out by interconnected Logic gates. Turning your code into **SOFTWARE**.

Every character 
The goal is to turn it into an explicit list of insturctions. These instructions are carried out by interconnected Logic gates. Turning your code into **SOFTWARE**.while writing code truly matters.

**Mistakes leave the computer in a state of panic.**

*CODE IS DELICATE*

# Algorithm
-An algorithm starts a problem and a great algorithm gets a name.
-Computer science is about understanding the efficiency of algorithms.

### Why Are Programmers So Intense About Languages

Programers track the success of computer languages the way others track sports.

## The worlds most used computer languages are:

* Java 
* C
* C++
* Objectivs-C
and
* C#

#### Runner-ups:
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Python

Most languages are free to download and use, being that when a language is created efficiently its considered a huge accomplishment and you would want it to bee free so more people use your creation.
