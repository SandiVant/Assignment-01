# What is Coding?

**Code** is a programming language used to tell the computer what needs to occur.


**C++** is used for games.
i.e. playstation, Xbox.

**PHP** is used for webpages.
i.e. etsy, facebook.

**Python** is general purpose.
i.e. Instagram, scientist.

**JavaScript** is used for software.
i.e. amazon.


# With Code

The computer takes the code and reads the language carefully, taking out unnecessary elements and leaving only tokens. The computer then organizes the tokens using a process called compilation util it is translated over to machine language.

-Humans write code, which turns into software.

##### There are 11 million professional software developers on earth. 7 billion do it for a hobby.

# Lets Begin

-Acomputer is a clock with benefits.
-Code hops from box to box looking for instruction.
-Code is the art.

#### How would you type "A"?

When typing on a keyboard, it sends a scancode.

If you were to type a letter for example the computer takes note of the signal from the keyboard; the version in memory; and the lines-and-circles version sketched in the screen. 

# From Hardware to Software

Software- Reproducible units of digital execution.

# How does code become software?

The goal is to turn it into an explicit list of insturctions. These instructions are carried out by interconnected Logic gates. Turning your code into **SOFTWARE**.

Every character 
The goal is to turn it into an explicit list of insturctions. These instructions are carried out by interconnected Logic gates. Turning your code into **SOFTWARE**.while writing code truly matters.

**Mistakes leave the computer in a state of panic.**

*CODE IS DELICATE*

# Algorithm
-An algorithm starts a problem and a great algorithm gets a name.
-Computer science is about understanding the efficiency of algorithms.

### Why Are Programmers So Intense About Languages

Programers track the success of computer languages the way others track sports.

## The worlds most used computer languages are:

* Java 
* C
* C++
* Objectivs-C
and
* C#

#### Runner-ups:
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Python

Most languages are free to download and use, being that when a language is created efficiently its considered a huge accomplishment and you would want it to bee free so more people use your creation.

# The Beauty of the Standard Library
The Standard Library is how a programming language software is made.
A language is software for maling software.
* The standard library is a set of premade software that you can reuse and apply.
* Most modern languages have modules for image processing.
* Pillow is the most commonly used image processing toolkit.

# C:

C is a simple language which works well if you are a meticulous arranger. If you are more on the sloppy side, it won't suit your needs as much. I uses ever last part of the computer- the memory, files, and a hard drive. There are many steps to masking C a fast software. These steps are called **optimizations** which are to programming, as loopholes are to taxes. The C Programmibng language by Ritchie and Brian Kernighan, Published in 1978 is a great C referance to start off.

* *With squares function you feed it a number, an integer. Then it counts from 1 to that integer and with each count it prints the square of that number. Then it prints a new line. Done."

* C is a language you use for building systems
* Java is an object-oriented language, influenced by C++, that runs on a virtual machine (just like Smalltalk).
* Objective-C, per its name, jammed C and Smalltalk together with no apologies.
* C# (pronounced “C sharp”) is based on C and influenced by Java, but it was created by Microsoft for use in its .NET framework.
* C++ is an object-oriented version of C, although its roots are more in Simula.

* Python is object oriented but not rigid and easier than C. However it is slower than C. It has a deserved reputation as a “glue language,” meaning you can take code from other, lower-level languages such as C, C++, and Fortran 77. Python is hard to connect to Java but fits C perfectly. Python has a variation designed to run inside of Java and use Java code. That’s called **Jython**. If you want a version that works with Microsoft’s .NET, you can go with IronPython.

# Why Are Coders Angry?

Coding has become a culture and you have to be able to think creatively in order to come up with solutions. It can be aggravating because you may want help from very talented programmers. But you are better off just figuring it out yourself.

* When having a programming job it is important to get things done on time so that the business doesn't suffer. This is called to “ship” software.

# Liquid Infrastructure

“Enterprise” is a feared word among programmers, because it is underated in the sence if workload. 
They have department meetings and tests which are important because there are many moving pieces.

# Fun Facts:
* Eventually, people realized that if they didn’t like the Java language, they could write other languages that compile to Java “bytecode” and run on the Java virtual machine (JVM). Which give you have access to thousands and thousands of incredibly well-thought-out and totally functional free libraries that you can use to get your work done. Anything Java can do, Clojure can do. And since it’s built atop the JVM, it can do it on any computer. ‘

* One might use JavaScript to make a more interesting Web page, make the client-side of a full-fledged application, like Google Docs, that runs in the browser. You might use it to make a Web server that talks to a Web browser. Or you might use it to make an Application Programming Interface 31 that serves up data to a “client".

* Coding in PHP for a living is not a death sentence. Lots of people have gotten rich off PHP. It just means a lot of cutting and pasting, and a lot of trips to Google to figure out why things aren’t working.

* A lot of program in PHP, and they are smart, good people. PHP powers Etsy and Facebook. It powers Wikipedia, WordPress. Out of all the Web’s pages, an enormous percentage is created with PHP.

* Sometimes bugs cause error messages to pop up; sometimes they cause the program to give up the ghost and quit suddenly; sometimes they get caught in terrible loops and fill up the memory and choke all the resources of the computer until it has to be restarted. That’s called a *stack overflow.*
